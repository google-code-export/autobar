   * Disable invert buttons on offhand buff
  * Drag & Drop
   * Items need to be draggable onto the category in the tree part of the config.
   * Items dragged onto a custom button automatically create a custom category if it does not have one & drop into it
   * Buttons need a drop setting that if enabled allow items to be dragged right onto the button itself
   * Categories in a button & items inside a category need to be draggable to rearrange them
  * Custom Categories need to be able to pick LibPeriodicTable-3.1 sets for their contents.
  * Full Mount support, including form switching, automatic flying vs ground selection, etc.

   * Grouped moving
  * For custom categories allow direct selection of a PT3 set
   * Optional priority set that takes precedence over the regular set for a particular item's value.  For example conjured food over regular.
   * Split out ItemList as a translation / grouping / priority layer on top of PT3.
  * Highlighting so you can see your custom categories / buttons more easily
  * Plugin architecture for buttons so this can become more of a framework
