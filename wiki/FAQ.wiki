=== How can I get the easy & classic AutoBar back? ===
 * On the Profile tab select the "Reset" button next to the "Single (Classic) Setup" button. This gives you a single character layer as with the Classic AutoBar but with the current defaults which have changed quite a bit.
 * On the Slots tab, drag and drop the slots on the bottom "Character Layer" if you want to change their order. This is faster than classic AutoBar which had no way to do this.
 * To modify a slot itself click on it to edit it on the bottom "Character Layer" of the Slots tab. This brings up the list of 16 categories or items you can have in a slot.
  * Drag and drop to rearrange items in the list.
  * Drag items from your bags to add custom items. This is faster than the clunky manual typing of classic AutoBar for adding custom items.

=== How can I find out if my bug is in AutoBar or some other mod? ===
 # Please make sure you are running the latest version. This will be on wowace.com/files
 # Disable all other mods except AutoBar. If you still get the error then it is an AutoBar bug.
 # Otherwise keep adding half of the disabled mods back etc. & narrow down which one is causing an error for you.
 # Please say what version you are running when reporting a bug, it saves me a lot of time.
