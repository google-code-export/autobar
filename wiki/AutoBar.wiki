= Introduction =

AutoBar provides a configurable set of 24 slots that automatically display items in your inventory for easy use. You can assign hot keys to a slot. Each slot can be customized to have whatever you want in it. You can have specific items smart selfcast if your target is not valid. Slots with multiple items in your bags can have a popup list of the items to choose from.

 * How to [Customize] your AutoBar

= Examples =

*Bandage Slot*
 * It will always show the best bandage available.
 * In battlegrounds it will show the BG specific bandage if you have it. 

*Potion Slots*
 * It will show the best potion available
 * A popup list lets you use cheaper potions if you have any 

*Protection Potions Slot*
 * From Arcane to Shadow & even Invulnerability and Spell reflection potions. 

*Weapon Buff Slot*
 * Includes Mana and Wizard Oils, Sharpening and Weight Stones, Rogue poisons.
 * The items rearrange on use so the last used item becomes the default. 

*Mount Slot*
 * This will show your current mount with a popup of other mounts in your bags.
 * Ahn'Qiraj mounts show up if you are in AQ40.
 * The rearrange on Use checkbox is set by default for Mounts so when you click on a mount in the popup that becomes your default mount.

*Food Slot*
 * Any of dozens of foods automatically go into this slot. You can set up more slots for foods with buffs so you can eat those as appropriate. 

*Pet Food*
 * You can set up a slot with pet food and enable having a right mouse button click feed the pet. 

*Make your own Slots*
 * Found some stuff not yet supported in Autobar? Drag & drop it into your own custom slots.

= Limitations =
*This mod is for using items in your bags only. NO SPELLS are supported, this includes paladin & warlock mounts. 
*Similarly it is not for using equiped items. You can drag an item into a slot so that you can click AutoBar to equip it, however autobar will not "use" any special abilites of the item once it is equiped because at that point it is no longer in your bags. 
*For trinkets I would recommend something like [[TrinketMenu]], for armor & weapons, [[Itemrack]] is an excellent addon. 
*No cooldown counter beyond the blizzard one. If you need one, please use [[OmniCC]], it works with pretty much all mods.
