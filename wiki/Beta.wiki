[http://files.wowace.com/cat-action-bars.html]

Note that this is a beta, a particular release may not be stable, you may need to reset your options from time to time & lose customizations you have made.  All options and features may not be working yet.

= What is not working right now? =

 * cyCircled breaks with the alpha ;-(
  *Get the latest cyCircled please

 * The bar fade setting is not functional
 * Last button on the popup is mia
 * Make rows * columns limit active Buttons displayed.

 * Button specific options mia
  * Turn the summoning aspect off for the food/water buttons
 * Right click targets pet does not work?
 * Drag & Drop
  * Items need to be draggable onto the category in the tree part of the config.
  * Items dragged onto a button go into its top custom category or automatically create a custom category if it does not have one
  * Buttons need a drop setting that if checked allow items to be dragged right onto the button itself
  * Categories in a button & items inside a category need to be draggable to rearrange them
 * Custom Categories need to be able to pick PeriodicTable-3.0 sets for their contents.
 * Full Mount support, including form switching

= What is in the new version? =

 * This is a rewrite of AutoBar and its config system.
 * The state machine for the popups is rewritten and much simpler than the old one.
 * Ace style profiles are used, allowing you to make character, class, etc. profiles, save them, and swap between them.
 * There are more buttons available, some with overlapping functionality. This is intentional.  Pick the ones you want and disable any buttons you do not want.
 * Built in Buttons are named and keybindings are directly to that Button, so if you move the Button around your keybinding still works.

 * Preferences
  * All Preferences are configuarable via Waterfall in a tree style view
  * FuBar or the minimap has an AutoBar button which lets you bring up the Preferences.
  * Double click on the AutoBar FuBar icon or minimap icon to bring up the config

 * Custom Categories: Categories/New
  * You can create new custom categories that are available to all your characters
  * Click on your category and name it
  * Open the tree to the items inside it & click *New* for however many items you need.
  * Click on each item.  This reveals a dragLink icon (empty one looks like a gift box) and a delete button for it.
  * Drag a *spell* or *item* onto the dragLink icon.  You can drag from inventory, bags, action bars, or your spellbook.
  * You can click on the Delete button to get rid of an item.

 * Custom Buttons: *Bars/<My Bar>/Buttons/New*
  * You can create new custom buttons for your current profile.
  * Add one or more custom categories to the button with *<My Button>/Categories/Add*
  * A default category with Hearthstone shows up.  Click its Popup & select your Custom Category instead.
  * Enable or Disable your custom button just like a regular button.

 * Bar movement: *Move the Bars*
  * Shift click the AutoBar _icon_, or select *Move the Bars* to make all your bars moveable and green (if shown) or red (if hidden).
  * Click-drag to move the bar.
  * Left click on the bar to hide (red) / show (green) the bar.
  * Right click the bar to bring up a config drop down for that bar.
  * Select *Move the Bars* again to lock the bars in place.
  * If *Sticky Frames* is on then the bars will be "sticky" and snap to other AutoBar bars.  Eventually this stickiness will extend to other bars and frames beyond AutoBar.

 * Druid Forms: *Bars/Druid*
  * The Druid Bar contains buttons for Cat, Bear, Travel as well as Tree of Life / Boomkin
  *  You can bind keys to these from the Blizzard keybind interface
  *  
  *  These are still a work in progress  &the icons dont actually display.

= What is still planned for the new version? =

 * Multiple bars are supported and you will be able to add your own custom bars soon.
 * Popup on shift.  There is just one more bug to iron out in the test state machine then this can be incorporated.
 * Items need to be shuffled as a bag location gets depleted during combat
 * Plugin architecture for buttons so this can become more of a framework
 * For custom categories allow direct selection of a PT3 set + an optional priority set (that takes precedence over the regular set for a particular item's value.  For example conjured food over regular)
 * Finish macro buttons.
  * Editable text for a custom macro
  * Ability to use one of the macros from Blizzard's macro interface.
 * Buttons
  *Finally do a proper mount button (a Macro Button)
  * Trinket buttons
 * Upgrade the StickyFrames "library" to handle multiple source frames via a registration mechanism & update BT3 to use it.  This would allow "sticky" dragging of AutoBars & "docking" them to BT3 & other bar mods using the StickyFrames stuff.
 * Customization via Waterfall is barely functional & needs drag & drop rearranging + icons in the tree view at a minimum.

= What do I do if I want to go back to the old version? =

 * Simply download the old one from the downloads section.
 * Your settings will remain the same (assuming you do not delete your saved variables)
 * If you reassigned any key bindings you will have to fix that yorself.
