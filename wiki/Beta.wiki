#Documentation for the new AutoBar Beta.

= Where can I get the beta? =

[http://files.wowace.com/cat-action-bars.html]

= What is in the new version? =

* This is a rewrite of AutoBar and its config system.
* The state machine for the popups is rewritten and much simpler than the old one.
* Ace style profiles are used, allowing you to make character, class, etc. profiles, save them, and swap between them.
* There are more buttons available and you can now simply disable any buttons you do not want.
* Built in buttons are named and keybindings are directly to that button, so if you move it around your keybinding still works.


= What is still planned for the new version? =

* Multiple bars are supported and you will be able to add your own custom bars soon.

= What do I do if I want to go back to the old version? =

* Simply download the old one from the downloads section.
* Your settings will remain the same (assuming you do not delete your saved variables)
* If you reassigned any key bindings you will have to fix that yorself.
