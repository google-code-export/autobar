= Where can I get the beta? =

[http://files.wowace.com/cat-action-bars.html]

Note that this is a beta, a particular release may not be stable, you may need to reset your options from time to time & lose customizations you have made.  All options and features may not be working yet.

= What is in the new version? =

 * This is a rewrite of AutoBar and its config system.
 * The state machine for the popups is rewritten and much simpler than the old one.
 * Ace style profiles are used, allowing you to make character, class, etc. profiles, save them, and swap between them.
 * There are more buttons available and you can now simply disable any buttons you do not want.
 * Built in buttons are named and keybindings are directly to that button, so if you move it around your keybinding still works.
 * Preferences
  * All Preferences are configuarable via Waterfall in a tree style view
  * FuBar or the minimap has an AutoBar button which lets you bring up the Preferences.
 * Custom Categories
  * You can create new custom categories that are available to all your characters
  * You can drag & drop items from your bags or inventory or spell book onto the icon in the category list.
 * Custom Buttons
  * You can create new custom buttons for your current profile. *AutoBar/Bars/<MyBar>/Buttons/New*
  * Add a custom category to the button with *<MyButton>/Categories/Add*
 * Bar movement: *AutoBar/Move the Bars*
  * Selecting "Move the Bars" option to make all your bars green (or red if hidden) and moveable.
  * Click-drag to move the bar.
  * Left click on the bar to hide (red) / show (green) the bar.
  * Right click the bar to bring up a config drop down for that bar.
  * Select "Move the Bars" again to lock the bars in place.
  * If *AutoBar/Sticky Frames* is on then the bars will be "sticky" and snap to other AutoBar bars.  Eventually this stickiness will extend to other bars and frames beyond AutoBar.


= What is still planned for the new version? =

 * Multiple bars are supported and you will be able to add your own custom bars soon.

= What do I do if I want to go back to the old version? =

 * Simply download the old one from the downloads section.
 * Your settings will remain the same (assuming you do not delete your saved variables)
 * If you reassigned any key bindings you will have to fix that yorself.
