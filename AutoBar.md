# Introduction #

AutoBar provides a configurable set of Buttons that automatically display items in your inventory for easy use. You can assign hot keys to Buttons. Each Button can be customized to have whatever you want in it. Buttons with multiple items in your bags can have a popup list of the items to choose from.
